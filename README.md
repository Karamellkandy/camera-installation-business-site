# Client Business Website – CCTV & Security System Services

This is a real-world business website I developed for a client (my father), who provides CCTV camera installation, intercom systems, access control, and related security services. The purpose of the website is to professionally showcase his services, educate customers, and convert visitors into inquiries through a contact form.

## 📌 Features

- **Home Page** – Clear overview of the business and services
- **About Us Page** – Background of the company, mission, and values
- **Projects Page** – Real project examples and images of past installations
- **FAQ Page** – Answers to common questions for client transparency
- **Contact Page** – A contact form allowing visitors to inquire or request quotations via email

### Service Pages:
Each service has its own detailed page that explains:
- What the service is
- Why it's important
- How it can protect homes or businesses
- Persuasive content to encourage conversions

Services include:
- CCTV Installation
- Camera Sales
- Intercom Systems
- Access Control Solutions
